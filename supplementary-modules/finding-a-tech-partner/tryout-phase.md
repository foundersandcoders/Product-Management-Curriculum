# Tryout Phase

Your goal is to find a long term software development partner. Jumping into a relationship too quickly can prove costly. It’s a good idea to get to know your agency’s team a bit before you start. When you meet them give them time to ask you questions, too. 

Look for a team that will provide discovery and design services on a short term contract. Before the first sprint, the agency should dedicate time and resources into training you as a product owner. Ideally, they’ll run workshops that will teach you about their processes and tools. Alternatively,  ****they could also provide handbooks or video tutorials to introduce you to their tools.

You want to find a tech partner that is transparent and flexible about their tools and processes. If you don’t agree with certain tools, they should be adaptable to that and agree on tools that work best for both sides. 

During this initial phase, you should assess the working relationship with the agency, their critical and creative thinking as well as their engagement level. 

#### Working relationship 

Assess how your teams are working together.  Keep an eye on communication. Timely communication is critical for a strong working relationship.

#### **Critical and creative thinking** 

Assess the agency’s ability to critique and ideate. How does the agency cope with roadblocks? How do they mitigate risks?

You’re looking for a partner who engages in creative discussion, pushes back on some assumptions.

#### **Engagement level** 

Engagement is one of the most important characteristics of a successful product team**.** Assess the engagement level of key team members working on your project. Are the developers assigned to multiple projects or only working on yours?
