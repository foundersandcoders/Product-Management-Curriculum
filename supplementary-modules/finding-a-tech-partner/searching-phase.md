# Searching Phase

## Key Tips 

#### Find a partner that has worked with clients in the charity sector

It is beneficial if your tech partner understands the challenges, tasks, stakeholders etc that you deal with in your sector.

**Review portfolios and case studies**

If they have a portfolio, spend some time browsing through it, focusing on the designs and the performance of their products. Find out if they have  done any project similar to yours, regarding the industry, technology or product features. 

**Consider the size and culture**

It can be beneficial to choose a company similar to yours in terms of size because you want to be treated as a VIC \(very important customer\). If the company is too big, they may not give you enough attention. If they are too small, they may not have enough experience to work on such a scale.

Both big and small companies have advantages and disadvantages. Go for an agency/developer that can cope with the size of your company and covers all your need at a reasonable budget and time.
