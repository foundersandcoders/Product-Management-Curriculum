# Mentor Notes

## Mentoring 

Each workshop should be run by two facilitators who take turn in presenting the content and exercises. 

Due to the limited resources that charities often face, the workshops should be kept as short as possible. We recommend half a day for each core module. 

## Participants 

We recommend delivering this curriculum to groups of two or three charities. In our experience, larger group sizes compromise the collaborative nature of the workshops. Each charity should be represented by one person who acts as the project lead within their organisation. 

We found that previous participants particularly valued the collaborative nature of the workshops. Therefore, charities should be grouped in a way that encourages cooperation between participants and leverages the collaborative nature of the curriculum. To this end, we propose to consider the following criteria when grouping participating charities:  

**Primary grouping criteria**

* Shared interest/problem area 
* Similar progress status within the product development 

**Secondary grouping criteria** 

* Shared level of commitment 
* Mixed level of expertise\*
* Availability & location

**\*** Circles with mixed levels of experience can provide an opportunity for lesser experienced charities to learn from more experienced charities.

## Facilities

We found that the workshop space \(size and layout\) impacts level of collaboration/dialogue between charities. Therefore, we recommend delivering the workshops in a room that allows the participants to move and communicate freely. We also suggest that the room has a projector or a large screen as well as a whiteboard or flip chart. If this is not available, we recommend that the facilitators bring large white paper for the exercises. 

Facilitators should also bring pens and post-it notes to each workshop. 

## **Communication** 

All communication with the participants should be handled via Slack. Participants should be provided with the [Slack Handout ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cFVKr1KBoQXoOpvd308tFuTkoH19FuUUOSmxLJnP4hg/edit)to help them sign up to Slack. 

Participants should be informed about the agenda of each workshop in advance so that they know what to expect. This information should be provided on Slack at least one hour ahead of the workshop. 

## Feedback 

After each workshop, the coaches should obtain feedback from the participants.
