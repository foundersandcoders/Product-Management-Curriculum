  Discovery Learning Programme (DLP) is a programme produced in collaboration with CAST under a larger umbrella project to train charities in digital service design and how to communicate about the development of a digital solution. Our cohort was made up of 9 distinct charities. The organisations followed our bespoke course which culminated in the formation of a solution brief that shaped their applications to the next phase of development.

# Case Study: Discovery Learning Programme

## Introduction

With a combination of theory and collaborative tasks, the **Discovery Learning Programme** was made up of 8 workshops over four weeks both with theoretical presentations and design sprint exercises. In addition to this, our team provided coaching call sessions twice throughout the programme and whenever required by the assigned organisation (3 per facilitator). This was a vital way of furthering the support towards shaping decisions for the application process. We asked the organisations to present their learnings back to the cohort in the second and fourth weeks. On both occasions, the presentations were a big turning point for the participants; in processing the activities this way they were able to reflect on their understanding and share insights that could be adapted for use by their peers.

**DLP** focused on providing an educational space for 9 distinct charity groups to work on identifying their problem areas. The organisations had a general idea of what they needed to evaluate and the exercises in this programme encouraged them to open up the problem area to discover the highest priorities that would form the beginnings of a solution.

By the end of the first week, the participants already had a written script and conducted their user research. Early in the process, this put them in a position where they could make informed decisions about what part of the problem area was critical to their users. Keeping the user centricity at the heart of this programme, research and usability testing was continued throughout ensuring that the solutions were grounded in the needs of the users and what would really make impact.

Moving forward from the programme, the organisations had three directions they could go in the next phase with CAST. Continuing with user research and discovery, using off-the-shelf solutions or a bespoke development - each organisation was guided towards being a position to follow one of these options based on what they had discovered about their problem area and user groups. They were also given the skillset and tools to be able to communicate about digital service design for other funding applications, having learnt the right language and understanding the process of development.
