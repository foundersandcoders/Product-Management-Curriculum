  My Best Life (MBL) is a programme run by New Philanthropy Capital (NPC). During Phase 2 of My Best Life, Founders and Coders assisted with the creation and facilitation of design sprint workshops which were completed by a team made up of representatives from NPC, Founders and Coders, charity partners UK Youth, The Mix and Leap Confronting Conflict, and members of UK Youth Voice.

# Case Study: My Best Life

## Introduction

During MBL phase 1, NPC and the MBL charity partners had identified three problem areas faced by young people in reaching youth service provision. Phase 2 aimed to take each of these problem areas as a starting point for a design sprint - to find a digital solution idea for each and create a prototype that can be usability tested and potentially developed further.

While the initial plan was to run a design sprint and prototype for each of three issues, the COVID-19 lockdown began as phase 2 did. Some time was lost to transitioning what would have been a face-to-face process into a remote one, and only two design sprints were run by the close of that phase of the programme.

The structure of MBL design sprints was based heavily on the [Google Ventures design sprint](https://www.thesprintbook.com/how) as outlined in 'Sprint: How to Solve Big Problems and Test New Ideas in Just Five Days' by Jake Knapp. The materials advised for use during the sprint (whiteboards, sticky notes, sticky dots etc) were replicated remotely using the Miro online whiteboarding tool. 

Google Ventures' (GV) design sprint is perhaps the most popular published design sprint structure and likely the basis of many others. Since its publishing, there have been many adaptations and additions to exercises for particular situations. Although the stock GV sprint was preferred for MBL, Founders and Coders have since used adapted sprints tailored closer to the needs of their specific participants and problem areas.

## Reflections

* Initially, workshops were planned to be a full day in length as would be normal for a face-to-face sprint. After a test session, a full day of remote sprint was discovered to be too long, and the programme was restructured to take place over half day workshops. While the length of sprint exercises is malleable to the length of time available, we found that many could be cut significantly while still being productive.
* The three problem areas we began with focused on youth services issues, but were otherwise very broad. This created a wide range of areas that could be targeted for a digital solution and it became difficult to facilitate a decision with such a range of voices in the room. The GV design sprint recommends appointing a "Decider" who has final say. To keep things democratic this role was avoided for MBL, but in hindsight it may have been useful and is recommended if there is someone on the sprint team who would be appropriate for the role. In lieu of a Decider, dot voting is a good way to make choices. It may be wise with a smaller sprint team to allot more dot votes, otherwise it can be hard to identify a favourite amongst several solution options.
* Storyboarding is the last exercise in the sprint as suggested by GV and involves drawing frames of the solution step-by-step as the user would see them. As this is a group activity and time consuming it was too difficult to replicate effectively during MBL using remote, online tools. Instead we used a 'user flow' exercise where the equivalent frame is described on a note in text. The frames could show different user journeys through the solution via arrows from note to note.
* GV recommends creating "how might we" questions during 'Ask the Experts'. However without an expert or with a broader area to ask around, we found it is fine to ask questions loosely around the problem area itself, or if you have done a mapping exercise, ask questions about stages on the map.
* The 'Notes' part of the sketching exercises can be less useful if you're running a quicker sprint - people usually have the previous exercises still at the forefront of their minds.
* 'Choosing a Target' can easily become a lengthy discussion if allowed, as can other points where significant choices are to be made. If you're short on time try to avoid the discussion and head straight for dot voting. Useful points or avenues for exploration will have to be left behind, especially with a broad problem area. Make note of them for another time.
* If you are reflecting as a group on an exercise such as 'How Might We', reading out every note is time consuming and can be boring when the participants could easily read themselves. Instead it may be worth giving a small amount of time to read through a lot of info and reflect personally, then continue discussion from there.
* Maps should be composed of interactions that a user will do towards their goal (create a post, book an appointment, choose a product etc). How might we questions can be added to the appropriate stages of the map afterwards. Creating a map out of questions to begin with quickly becomes confusing and will make choosing a target area difficult.
* During MBL we did two full design sprints. For each we created a different map with stages and goal tailored to the problem area. However, really the stages and goal should have been the same for both. A better method may have been to define the maps stages and goal universally, and tailor the how might we questions to the specific problem area. That way, solutions that had benefits towards both problem areas could more easily have been defined, and confusion around the purpose of the exercise could have been alleviated.
