  Discovery Learning Programme (DLP) is a programme produced in collaboration with CAST under a larger umbrella project to train charities in digital service design and how to communicate about the development of a digital solution. Our cohort was made up of 9 distinct charities. The organisations followed our bespoke course which culminated in the formation of a solution brief that shaped their applications to the next phase of development.
