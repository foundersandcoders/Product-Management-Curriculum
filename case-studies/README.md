## About Case Studies

We have found that a variety of factors such as overall purpose, cohort size or make-up, time constraints and existing product research or knowledge have affected the structural design of each programme. Rather than reusing a set structure for each iteration, we have chosen a bespoke structure from this [list of exercises](../list-of-exercies/README.md) which we believed would best suit each scenario. 

When you come to design your own programme of exercises it is worth considering the purpose, time, personnel and product you will be dealing with, and build a programme accordingly. Some exercises have been constants and easily lead into others, while some are useful in specific cases and are used where appropriate. In the end the choice is up to you.

These case studies show the structures we chose in a few different situations, with justification for the exercises selected and reflections on how that affected the process and results.

## History of Tech for Better

These case studies have been programmes under the Founders and Coders 'Tech for Better' umbrella. You can read about the history and development of this wider programme [here](./history.md).
