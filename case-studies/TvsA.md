# Case Study: Tech vs Abuse

## Introduction

Our proposed engagement on Tech vs Abuse was to deliver an intensive training programme in Discovery, Definition, Prototyping and Product Management. The delivery of this programme was intended to be the validation of this curriculum. What we didn't know when planning this programme was the intesity of the broader Tech vs Abuse programme. Fitting our engagement into this programme proved a bridge too far and so we pivoted to validate this curriculum on a smaller scale as a dedicated programme, the [Collbaorative Digital Training](./CDT.md).
