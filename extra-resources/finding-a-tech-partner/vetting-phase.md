# Vetting Phase

During this phase, we recommend meeting with shortlisted agencies face-to-face to get a clear idea of: 

* the company’s culture
* their approach to product and software development
* suitability for your project 
* their approach to project quotes and estimates

A final decision should be taken after in-person interviews. We have listed some questions below that you can bring to this meeting. We suggest that project managers compare agencies by creating a standard list of questions to ask. We also suggest weighting the questions so that you have reflected and understood the priorities for your project 

The initial discussions should focus on conveying your product idea, rather than getting into exact pricing. The meeting helps the agency ask more information in order to give more accurate information. The more relevant information you can provide to an agency, the more they can narrow down their estimate. We recommend you bring the following to this meeting: 

* User stories
* Project Background 
* Problems/Idea/Business Objective/Data 
* User Personas if applicable
* References i.e. inspirational apps if applicable

Big price differences between agency estimates after initial meetings may indicate that your scope needs to be better defined. 

You should vet the shortlisted candidates on three categories: **technology fit**, **product fit** and **process fit**. 

## Technology Fit 

To avoid technical debt and poor infrastructure decisions, you should research the agency’s preferred languages and frameworks. It’s important to build a foundation with modern, growing technologies that will entice future developers and partners in the project’s future. 

We recommend you address some of the following questions in your meeting to access technology fit: 

**What languages, frameworks, and libraries do you prefer to build with?**

Working with frameworks and libraries that have growing communities and established conventions will help with future hiring, maintenance and feature iteration. A mobile or web app is not a one-time investment - you will have to update it regularly. To make your product future proof, it is vital that you ensure that the agency is using modern, growing technologies.

Use this question to find out if they are experts in a few frameworks/languages. You want to avoid working with a 'jack of all trades, master of none'. 

Rather than looking for agencies with a wide range of technologies, it is important to understand whether the technologies that an agency uses meets your scope or budget needs. A common mismatch arises for mobile when an app requires native iOS/Android development for performance, but an agency uses mostly Ionic for cross-platform development. 

Consult with your mentor or coach to assess the proposed tech stack. 

#### **Do you feel those technologies are the right choice for this project?**

Use this question to gauge if the team is flexible, realistic and adaptable. It can also help you to find out if agency has the ability to simplify and articulate technical details. Plus, having a high-level understanding of how your applications work will help with investors, advisors and future employees

#### **What limitations do you see working with this technology stack?**

There is no silver bullet! So ‘none’ is an inadequate answer, push for response. Use this question to gauge if team is open to exploration and discovery. 

**What are your considerations around scalability?**

Scalability is a very important aspect to make your product future proof. You want to favour agencies that consider this early and extensively. Maybe they can even provide previous examples of when they built a scalable architecture.

#### **What are your considerations around security?**

Security is equally important and should be taken into consideration by the agency. This can include concerns around safeguarding issues. 

#### **How do you ensure software quality?** 

Find out what people and processes they have in place to ensure high quality code. Do they use, for example, peer code review or automated tests? Or do they have a quality assurance expert in their team? 

You can add to this question: 

* Could you share with me your best practices for writing the code?
* Does your development team do regular code reviews? 
* Can you share how it is done?

#### **Do I own the source code once the project is finished?**

You need to be clear from the outset what you can and can’t expect towards the end of the project. Gauge the ****level of after-development support that is on offer. Have they provided after-development support to previous clients and how did that look like?

## Product Fit 

The more an agency is aware of your business, product and sector, the better they can help you focus on priorities, advise you from a technical perspective, and connect with your users. 

Look for an agency that can provide insights into the product, even pushes back on assumptions and considers the end user and business use case – not just the product development.

Use the following questions to quiz the agency on the business use case of your product!

#### **What core problem do you think is most important to our end users?**

Use this question to quiz them on their understanding of the product’s core value and user problem. 

#### **How would you solve that problem?**

This question can help you analyse team’s creativity, gauge if they are able to imagine alternative solutions and see how they think critically about user-friendly and feasible solutions

#### **What future iterations of this product do you imagine?**

Use this question to gauge if the team is able to think critically about product’s lifecycle

#### **What products in your portfolio are you most proud of and why?**

This question can help you find out what is valuable to the team. Do they focus on the product development and technologies, or do they consider the user and the wider impact of their project? 

## Process Fit

We recommend that you look for and insist on the agile process. It is a proven process for building successful products quickly and efficiently.

Use the following questions to find out if there is alignment in your values and work process, knowledge of the team dynamic and understanding of both businesses. 

#### **What processes/methodologies are you using for developing digital solutions?**

As mentioned above, we recommend that you insist on the agile process. If the agency doesn't use agile,  find out why and what advantages they see in their  processes over agile. 

#### **How often do you have planning sessions and how do these look like? Can I participate in these?**

You should be participating in planning session. This is one of your core tasks as Product Owner.

#### **Can I review a demo of the product at the end of each sprint?**

Each sprint should be finished with a demo of the product for you to review**.** 

#### **In your opinion, what makes for a good working client relationship?**

This is a good question to evaluate the culture/personality fit between you and the agency. What do you expect from us and what should we expect from you during the cooperation?

**How do we communicate during a project to know progress, plans and problems?**

It cannot be stressed enough how important regular communication is between you and the agency. There must be a mechanism/procedure that ensures you know what’s happening in the project. You must be updated at least on a bi-week basis. You NEED to know when things go wrong. Don’t hesitate to dig deeper on that question: 

* What communication channels are used? 
* Will we use an instant communication system?
* How do you ensure we know when things go wrong? Tell me how you handled a project in the past that went wrong.

Understand whether their communication style and workflow can match your company’s requirements.

## **Red Flags**

**Avoid a company that does not have any regular planning sessions.**

**Avoid yes-sayers.** You want to have a straightforward partner who is able to say ‘No’ if needed.

**Avoid a company that does not provide you with a local PM or does not allow you to manage the team.** This can be a sign that something is not as transparent or as professional as it should be

**Trust your guts**. Avoid a company if there’s no chemistry/mutual understanding.

**Avoid more than 6 hours time difference.** If you haven’t run a software development project in the past you will be surprised how many questions both sides can have once it starts. For that reason, a time difference is a key factor. You need to be able to jump on the call at least for two hours if a situation requires it.
