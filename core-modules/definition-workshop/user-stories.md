# User Stories

User Stories ****are the building blocks of Agile projects and represent the fundamental unit of communication and tracking progress. An Agile process is driven by the completion of stories, each of which provides tangible, demonstrable value to the user/customer/stakeholder. A sprint consists of a set of conscientiously prioritised stories. 

## Format

It's best to use a format for each story that identifies **who** the user is, **what** they need, and for what purpose \(the **why**\). Such stories are written in this format:

> “As a \_\_\_\_, I need a \_\_\_\_ in order to \_\_\_\_”.

* **who:**  someone with a particular functional role, who holds a certain title, comes from the perspective of a persona, or embodies the needs and behaviours of a hypothetical user.
* **what:** details in specific terms the need, feature, or functionality desired by the who. This is what your project team will build into the product or service.
* **why:** states the value. It presents the needs of your users and customers up front and centre.

> **Example:** _“As a jazz fan, I need a tuning knob in order to find a jazz station on the radio that I will enjoy listening to."_

## Keys to a valuable user story

Good user stories follow the INVEST model: 

* **Independent** 
* **Negotiable** 
* **Valuable:** A story must have value to someone. It must make the product better in some way.  Avoid exotic/one-off stories \(i.e. edge cases\).
* **Small** 
* **Testable** 

“_Clean up the bugs we introduced in the last sprint”_ is NOT a user story because it does not add anything to the product.

## Prioritising user stories

The high priority stories affect the most users or procure the highest value data.
