# Creative 8s

### Introduction

In this exercise, Product Managers will have to come up with eight new and slightly different ideas in rapid succession. By doing so, they are encouraged to diverge in their thinking as well as to think outside the box. 

### Required Materials

Paper and pens.

### Workflow

1. Each participant should be given a sheet of paper. They should then fold this sheet of paper \(once horizontally and twice vertically\) in order to get 8 sections of equal size. 
2. In each of these sections they should draw a different idea for how the product should look. This could be the whole app or just one aspect of it. We encourage participants to diverge as much and in whichever way they want - they could draw 8 different aspects or the same aspect 8 times. 
3. A timer should be set for one minute, after this goes off the participant must move on to the next panel. After 8 minutes are up, they should have a set of 8 drawings. 
4. Just like in [Idea Generation](idea-generation.md), we ask participants to swap their sheets. To give them a new source of inspiration, this time they should pass to the right. 
5. Again, the participants should be encouraged to discuss the new sheets they have in front of them. 
6. After some time for discussion, we encourage participants to dot vote the aspects that stand out to them from any of the sheets. The sheets should be moved somewhere accessible for everyone. It is good to limit the number of dots for this section to be between 3 and 5. Participants may dot an aspect of their own or can use all their dots on other people's sheets. 

### Collaboration

As with [Idea Generation](idea-generation.md), this exercise will encourage participants to take new insight on solving the problem. By inverting the direction of swaps the ideas remain fresh and enticing. 

This is the first exercise where we introduce more formal Dot Voting. This allows for participants to sum up the discussion in a non-verbal manner as well as to provide a record of which aspects were most popular. During the dot voting, the participants are not voting for their favourite panels but are focusing on aspects they find stand out.
