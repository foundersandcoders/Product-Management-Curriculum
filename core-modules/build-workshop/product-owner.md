  phase.

# Product Owner

## What is a Product Owner?

The Product Owner is a specific one-person role within the Scrum framework, which may be provided by the client or sit within the agency. As the product lead with your charity, you are predestined to act as a PO due to your business know-how and corporate authority.

## Responsibilities of a Product Owner

According to the SCRUM documentation, the product owner has three primary responsibilities:

### **1. Maximising the delivered value**

To this end, the PO must:

* know the business 
* have a vision of the product 
* be able to define the elements that create value
* be able to prioritise these elements according to this rule: 

> **first \(as far as dependencies allow\) the elements of maximum Value at least Cost.**

### 2. Managing the Product Backlog

The PO must ensure that a Product Backlog exists and is always up to date. The task of writing the Product Backlog can be delegated but the PO must participate in its definition and description. The PO must guide the people who write the Product Backlog.

The Product Backlog is a list of everything that is known to be needed in the product. It is the single **source of requirements** for any changes to be made to the product.

The Product Backlog:

* is **dynamic;** it constantly changes to identify what the product needs to be appropriate, competitive and useful. 
* sits **outside the sprint loop** \(meaning it contains work that will not be completed during the current sprint\) but informs how your sprint will be planned 
* is composed of feedback from **the development team, customer** and **stakeholders**
* contains **features, functions, requirements, enhancements** and **fixes**

Steps when creating a Product Backlog: 

1. **Add ideas to the backlog** **\(**based on feedback from dev team, customers, stakeholders\) 
2. **Get clarification** - ensure you understand the reason behind the item, the value it adds and any specifications of the item, such as [story points](../../glossary.md#story-point). 
3. **Prioritise** - clearly define, high-priority items should be at the top
4. **Update backlog regularly** and add top items to the next sprint cycle. 

TIP: Color-code each block to indicate an item is sufficiently refined and ready for sprint planning 

Prioritisation

* **Higher-priority items** should be refined and have great value to the product.
* **Mid-priority items** should be candidates for refinement \(the process of detailing each task\)
* **Low-priority items** should not be a dependency and can be safely ignored until they are candidates for refinement.

### 3. Leading & attending regular sprint events

The PO is responsible for leading the Sprint Planning and Sprint Reviews as well as attending the Sprint Retrospective. 

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Sprint Planning" %}
Sprint Planning is a regular event in the Scrum framework where the team determines the product backlog items they will work on during that sprint and discusses their initial plan for completing those product backlog items.

Sprint Planning answers the following:

* What can be delivered in the Increment resulting from the upcoming Sprint?
* How will the work needed to deliver the Increment be achieved?

During this meeting, the PO: 

* proposes a [Sprint Goal](../../glossary.md#sprint-goal) and defines Product Backlog items that will allow reaching this goal
* should help the dev team understand the Product Backlog items
* must be willing to negotiate the extend of the Sprint if it exceeds the team's capacity
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Sprint Review" %}
Sprint Review is an informal meeting at the end of each sprint.  During this meeting, the Scrum team shows what they accomplished during the sprint \(usually in form of a product demo\) and the project is assessed against the sprint goal determined during the sprint planning meeting. The result of the Sprint Review is a revised Product Backlog that defines the probable Product Backlog items for the next Sprint

Attendees: 

* Scrum Team 
* Key Stakeholders invited by PO 

The Sprint Review includes the following elements:

* PO explains what Product Backlog items have been “Done” and what has not been “Done”;
* Dev Team discusses what went well during the Sprint, what problems it ran into, and how those problems were solved;
* Dev Team demonstrates the work that it has “Done” and answers questions about the Increment;
* PO discusses the Product Backlog as it stands. He or she projects likely target and delivery dates based on progress to date \(if needed\);
* The entire group collaborates on what to do next, so that the Sprint Review provides valuable input to subsequent Sprint Planning 
* Review of how the marketplace or potential use of the product might have changed what is the most valuable thing to do next; and,
* Review of the timeline, budget, potential capabilities, and marketplace for the next anticipated releases of functionality and capability of the product.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Sprint Retrospective" %}
The Sprint Retrospective is a meeting for the Scrum Team to inspect itself and create a plan for improvements to be enacted during the next Sprint. It occurs after the Sprint Review and prior to the next [Sprint Planning](../../glossary.md#sprint-planning). By the end of the Sprint Retrospective, the Scrum Team should have identified improvements that it will implement in the next Sprint.

During the Sprint Retrospective, the team discusses:

* What went well in the Sprint?
* What could be improved?
* What will we commit to improve in the next Sprint?
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

> The sprint review looks at **what** the team is building, whereas the retrospective looks at **how** they are building it.



## Position of a Product Owner 

The PO mediates between the development team and the stakeholders. In Scrum, a stakeholder is anyone with a vested interest in the product who is not part of the Scrum Team.

![The PO between dev team and stakeholders](../../.gitbook/assets/productowner.jpg)

The PO represents stakeholders to dev team by: 

* providing timely information and decisions on requirements and priority
* being an active participant in customer testing
* facilitating requirements gathering

The PO represents dev team to stakeholders by: 

* demonstrating the solution to key stakeholders 
* announcing releases 
* communicating the team status
* negotiating priorities, scope and schedule 
* working closely with the [Scrum Master](../../glossary.md#scrum-master)

## Tasks of a Product Owner

### 1. Defining the vision 

To that end, the PO should create a [Product Roadmap,](../../glossary.md#product-roadmap) which is a high-level, tactical graphical summary that shapes the vision and direction for the product.

### **2. Managing the Product Backlog**

To manage the product backlog, the PO must split the goals into [User Stories](../../glossary.md#user-stories), prioritise these and provide them to the development team during the Sprint Planning. Managing the Product Backlog also includes trimming it, i.e. deciding what not to build. It is essential that the PO knows the backlog and all it's elements. If the developers have questions about the backlog, the PO is responsible for clarifying those details to the team. The product owners job is not to spoon feed user stories but to ensure that everyone understands the overall vision and that there are short feedback loops in terms of frequent deliveries to users.

### 3. Prioritising and anticipating client needs

To this aim, the PO needs to conduct studies like consumer behaviour analyses and research user preferences. These quantitative reports help product owners confirm the patterns they’re observing when studying customer stories.

The product owner should understand the market, the competition, and the users’ pain points. With those valuable pieces of information, the product owner can determine what features should be implemented, and in what order, with respect to time and importance. 

### 4. Overseeing development stages

The PO has to make sure that he/she is participating in the overall development stages of the product. The team might need their PO to get the clarity on a few queries or they might need to demo the committed item.

### 5. Acting as primary liaison

The PO acts as a liaison for business stakeholders and end-users, determining whether each story meets their shared expectations. The person in this role has to make sure the information flow is quick and clear so that there is no interpretation or reading between the lines.

The PO also needs to manage expectations on both ends.

### 6. Evaluating product progress

At each iteration, the PO makes sure that the development delivers the expected outcomes from the stories they worked upon and accepts it.

### 7. Terminating a sprint if necessary 

If the Sprint goal has no meaning \(will not deliver business value\) because of the extreme change, the product owner can terminate the sprint. The termination is most frequently the outcome of an intense change in business priorities  


## Requirements of a Product Owner

There are a number of requirements that a PO should fulfil to be effective in their role. These include: 

* **Availability:** The PO needs to be available to the team to do the day-to-day work. He/She must be an active participant in the project - not just a stakeholder waiting for features. 
* **Decidability:** A PO needs mandate to make decisions. He/she needs to be able to make decisions on the spot when, for instance, answering questions from the team
* **Accountability:**  A PO is responsible for creating value and manage expectations. The PO must be value oriented.
* **Knowledgeability:** A PO needs to be knowledgable of the value and the size of different user stories, of the business and how software development works.
* **Collaboration & Communication:**  A PO need to be committed to the team, a good communicator, have the ability to resolve conflicts. A PO needs to trust the team and the framework.

## Potential challenges of a PO

1. Missing product road map
2. High-level acceptance criteria
3. Spending too much time dealing with product support instead of grooming the backlog
4. Changing priority while sprint is in progress
