# The Burndown Chart

A burndown chart is a graphical representation of work left to do versus time. The Scrum Burndown Chart is a visual measurement tool that shows the completed work per day against the projected rate of completion for the current project release. It is a useful tool to help the PO and the team identify how much of the product can be delivered at any one time. Only stories that are **complete** may count towards the “burn”. 

A burndown chart for the Sprint should be a regular part of Scrum meetings as it helps the entire team identify whether or not they are on track. 

## Tracked values

A burndown chart tracks values along two axis:  The outstanding work is represented on the vertical axis, with time along the horizontal. Within this chart, exist multiple lines: 

* Red line – Expresses a vector from the maximum anticipated story points to zero — the ideal “red line”. This vector is the perfect function of points completed or “burned” per day.
* Green line – Shows a plot of of actual points complete for each day that passes. If you finish a 5 point story, 5 points are burned. The actual points completed may fall above or below the ideal schedule \(red line\) as the Sprint progresses. This is to be expected.
* Purple line – Shows the number of points planned. This number can go up or down if the team adds a “stretch story” or a story is removed because it’s blocked by external circumstances. In the example above, the team does not add or remove any stories to the Sprint, therefore the line stays flat.
* Blue line – Sometimes \(as pictured above\) there is a burn-up line, useful for predicting team patterns to find the “break even” point
