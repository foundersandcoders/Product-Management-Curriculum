# Assumptions Table

### Introduction

Examining the assumptions that a Product Manager is making will encourage them to think about their users' perspectives and how to validate whether these assumptions are true. 

### Required Materials

Paper and Pen. 

### Workflow

1. Create a table with two columns titled 'Assumptions' and 'Validated If'.
2. In the first column, write down all the assumptions we are making about our users and the product. 
3. In the second column, write down criteria for testing whether this assumption is valid or not. The criteria should be measurable through observation or research.



### Example

| **Assumption** | **Validated If** |
