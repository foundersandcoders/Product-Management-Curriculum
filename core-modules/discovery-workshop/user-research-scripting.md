# User Research Scripting

### Introduction

The information in this section can be used to inform Product Managers about the process of conducting user research. This should help to give insight into how to conduct good user research but is not a prescriptive method. Each Product Manager will have different users and questions to ask - some may find one-on-one interviews useful but this may not be appropriate in another context. 

### What?



### How?

Get as close to the real user base as possible - test with real users if possible and if not then go only one level removed. 

### Why?

User research is about learning what a user is trying to do and understanding what is and isn’t working for them. It’s not about asking them what they want.

User research allows Product Managers to test the assumptions they have before embarking 

### Tips

* Keep it short
* Be prepared and specific
* Look for stories
* Listen, don’t talk
* Be confidential
* Be mindful about diversity
* Ask permission before the interview
* Avoid any bias
* Don’t ask questions about the future
* Don’t pressure the interviewee

### Collaboration

During workshops, we ask a Product Manager to give their script to someone else and this person shall read the questions back to the Product Manager. This allows the Product Manager to understand how their questions sound and are phrased from the perspective of the user. They need not answer the questions but can make notes on phrasing, assumptions or things they think they might be missing.
