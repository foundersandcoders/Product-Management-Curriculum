# Mapping

### Introduction

Mapping serves as a way to make clear the path our users take to find a service, understand it and acheive their goals. This exercise gives a clear indication of where the common steps are for each organisation participating in the Design Sprint. The path should be guided by three categories: Discovery, Learning and Using.

Discovery is how the user finds the service for the first time.
Learning is the process of understanding the services offered by the charity.
Using is the steps towards acheiving the goal or at least getting closer to the goal.

### Required Materials

A common goal, [user personas](./user-personas/README.md), post-its, pens

_Or for remote delivery:_ Using Miro, or a similar service, create one space a large frame with each user at once side and the agreed common goal at the other. User Post-its and arrows to map steps across the frame.

### Workflow

1. On a large Miro board, whiteboard or blank wall place large post-its at either side. On the left hand side list the users of the app (these can be directly referencing User Personas). On the right hand side, list the common goal for the sprint.
1. Each Product Manager should start at their user and outline the steps required to acheive their goal through the stages of Discovery, Learning and Using.
1. Steps are formed in the context of actions the user takes to get to their goal, such as 'Search on Google (Discovery)', 'Browse available services (Learning)', or 'Book an appointment (Using)'.
1. Between each step there should be an arrow to indicate what comes next. There may be multiple paths so arrows can diverge wherever appropriate.
1. Facilitators should encourage participants to keep things simple and avoid superfluous steps where possible. The map should consist of between 5 and 15 steps.

### Collaboration

Although each Product Manager is drawing the path for their individual personification of their user group, they are working to find a path for these distinct groups of people to reach a common goal. During mapping it becomes clear where commonality lies in how distinct groups of users will find the digital service, use it and accomplish their goal. Often, two distinct groups of users will follow a similar path to accomplish their goal. Designing a path for both groups opens up the accessibility of the app and ensures we're designing for a diverse range of users.
