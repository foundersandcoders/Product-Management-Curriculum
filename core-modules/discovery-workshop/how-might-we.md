# How Might We (HMW)

### Introduction

How Might We allows participants to ask speculative questions that give a picture of the challenges that will be addressed during the sprints. This exercise forms a foundation for the sprint as well as identifying common problems and a common understanding of the sprint goal. 

### Required Materials

Post-its and pens

### Workflow

1. Individually, on separate Post-its, each person shall write down questions around the project goals or problem to solve. Each question should start with "How Might We..."
1. Once everyone has written their individual How Might We's, bring all the post-its together and as a group organise them into themes (e.g. accessibility, moving services online, providing digital skills)
1. Facilitators should help to guide participants to identify where there are intersections in their challenges.
1. Once there are clear themes and all post-its are categorised (it's okay for some to stand for their own theme), facilitators should set a short amount of time for everyone to dot-vote on the HMWs. Votes should be placed on the HMWs that participants think are the *most important* to focus on.
1. Facilitators should vote too and at the same time but should have less dots than Product Managers. We'd suggest a ratio of 3:1 - this can be adapted based on the number of participants and notes.
