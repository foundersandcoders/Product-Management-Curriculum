# Discovery Workshop

## Learning Outcomes

* Understand the individual stages of the development process
* Be introduced to agile methodology
* Utilising user-focused thinking
* Understand of how to test assumptions

## Product Management Experience

* Understanding the importance of their role
* Practising composing user research scripts
* Exploring the problem area and thinking about who is affected

## Our Homework

* Encouraging discussion between participants on Slack after the workshop
* Looking up topics or research that was in common between participants in the circle

## Participants' Homework

* Complete a small sample of user research - or if this is not possible, look up similar secondary research

_We need to conduct a Discovery workshop so that the charities can do user research while we learn more about their individual problem area and tech that might help solve their problem. Their user research and our tech research will come together in the Definition workshop._
