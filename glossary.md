# Glossary

### Agile 

Agile product management is an iterative process. It’s based on gathering user feedback and adapting accordingly. It helps product teams reduce waste through iterative work sprints. 

### Minimum Viable Product \(MVP\) 

A MVP is an early version of a product launched quickly in order to gather user feedback earlier in the product life cycle. It has just enough features to satisfy early customers and provide feedback for future product development.

### **Problem Statement**

A problem statement is one line that recasts the idea in human terms of what the technology allows your user to accomplish. They are expressed in one sentence, following a common template: _"**The user** needs a way to **do something** \(that addresses their needs\) so that **something happens** \(that benefits them\)”_

> **Example: As a** teenager who struggles to connect with others**, I’d like a way to** learn social cues **so I can** find friends and build relationships with my peers.

### Product Backlog

The Product Backlog is a list of everything that is known to be needed in the product. It is the single **source of requirements** for any changes to be made to the product. The Product Owner is responsible for [managing the Product Backlog](core-modules/build-workshop/product-owner.md#2-managing-the-product-backlog). 

### Product Manager 

The Product Manager creates the vision and direction for the product and then develops detailed plans on how to turn the vision into actual product features. Their responsibilities include setting business objectives, managing the product team, researching and testing with users, collecting data and stakeholder management. They need to possess sector and domain expertise. As opposed to Product Owners, Product Managers are strategic, they focus on the product’s vision, company objectives, and the market.

### Product Owner

The Product Owner is a specific one-person role within the Scrum framework, which may be provided by the client or sit within the agency. As the product lead with your charity, you are predestined to act as a PO due to your business know-how and corporate authority. During the build phase, the product owner has [three primary responsibilities](core-modules/build-workshop/product-owner.md#responsibilities-of-a-product-owner). As opposed to Product Managers, Product Owners are more tactical. They translate the product manager’s strategy into actionable tasks, and work with cross-functional agile teams to make sure they are executing on those requirements.

### Product Roadmap 

A product roadmap is a high-level visual summary that maps out the vision and direction of your product offering over time. A product roadmap communicates the why and what behind what you are building. A roadmap is a guiding strategic document as well as a plan for executing the strategy.

### Scrum Master

A **scrum master** is the facilitator for an Agile development team; they are responsible for managing the process, and only the process. They are not involved in the decision-making, but act as a lodestar to guide the team through the scrum process with their experience and expertise. People filling this role have to lead from a position of influence, often taking a servant-leadership stance.

### Sprint Goal 

The Sprint Goal is an objective to be met by the Sprint through the implementation of part of the Product Backlog. It provides guidance to the Development Team on why it is building the Increment. It is created during the [Sprint Planning ](glossary.md#sprint-planning)meeting. It should be **measurable, focused** and **clear.** 

> _**Bad example:** Enhance shopping cart functionality._
>
> _**Good example:** Streamline purchasing process to enable an increase in conversion rates._

### Sprint Planning 

Sprint Planning is a regular event in the Scrum framework where the team determines the Product Backlog items they will work on during that sprint and discusses their initial plan for completing those product backlog items. Sprint Planning is time-boxed to a maximum of eight hours for a one-month Sprint. For shorter Sprints, the event is usually shorter. The PO is responsible for [leading the Sprint Planning](core-modules/build-workshop/product-owner.md#3-leading-and-attending-regular-sprint-events). 

### Sprint Retrospective 

The Sprint Retrospective is a meeting for the Scrum Team to inspect itself and create a plan for improvements to be enacted during the next Sprint. It occurs after the Sprint Review and prior to the next Sprint Planning. This is at most a three-hour meeting for one-month Sprints. For shorter Sprints, the event is usually shorter. The PO should attend the Sprint Retrospective. 

### Sprint Review 

A Sprint Review is an informal meeting held at the end of the Sprint to inspect the Increment and adapt the Product Backlog if needed. It is at most a four-hour meeting for one-month Sprints. For shorter Sprints, the event is usually shorter. The Sprint Review is [led by the PO](core-modules/build-workshop/product-owner.md#3-leading-and-attending-regular-sprint-events). 

### Story Points 

Story points are a unit of measure for expressing an estimate of the overall effort that will be required to fully implement a product backlog item or any other piece of work. When we estimate with story points, we assign a point value to each item. The raw values we assign are unimportant. What matters are the _relative values_. A story that is assigned a 2 should be twice as much as a story that is assigned a 1.

### User Journey 

A user journey is a series of steps \(typically 4-12\) which represent a scenario in which a user might interact with the product. They can be used to demonstrate the way users **currently interact** with the product or describe the way users **could interact** with the product. They are usually created towards the beginning of a project, after user personas. 

### User Personas

User personas are representations of clusters of users with similar needs, goals, and behaviours. A persona is a single individual that represents a group. 

### User Research 

User research is conducted so as to understand users’ characteristics, aims, and behaviours towards achieving their aims. User research helps place people at the centre of your design process and your products.

### User Stories

User stories are short, simple descriptions of a feature told from the perspective of the person who desires the new capability, usually a user or customer of the system. They typically follow a simple template: 

> As a &lt; type of user &gt;, I want &lt; some goal &gt; so that &lt; some reason &gt;.

### User Testing 

User testing is the process through which the interface and functions of a website, app, product, or service are tested by real users who perform specific tasks in realistic conditions. The purpose of this process is to evaluate the usability of that website or app and to decide whether the product is ready to be launched for real users.
