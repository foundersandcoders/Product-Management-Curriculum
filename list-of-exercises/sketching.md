# Sketching

### Introduction

In this exercise, rather than tackling the whole problem in one monolithic effort, instead we break the task down into small steps needed to make progress. Working in this way allows an idea to evolve through the process and become more defined, it is also a way to avoid dwelling on less relevant ideas for too long.

### Three Steps

#### [Idea Generation](idea-generation.md)

This section allows participants to freely come up with ideas that link to the Product Manager's problem.

#### [Creative 8s](creative-8s.md)

During this exercise, participants will come up with eight quick sketches which show an aspect or idea for the solution.

#### [Solution Sketch](solution-sketch.md)

In this final section, the participants are encouraged to take aspects from each exercise to come up with a final vision of how the solution may look.

### Collaboration

During this section, we encourage participants to work alone for some time and then come together to share their ideas.

Working alone offers time to do research, find inspiration, and think about the problem. And the pressure of responsibility that comes with working alone often spurs us to our best work. When each person sketches alone, he or she will have time for deep thought.

Coming back together to share ideas encourages movement towards a consensus and convergence of ideas. After discussions have been had on the products of each step, we encouraged silent dot voting as a democratic way to encourage decision-making as well as to provide a record of the decision.
