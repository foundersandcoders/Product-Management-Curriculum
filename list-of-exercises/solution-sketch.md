# Solution Sketch

### Introduction

This part of the workshop will bring a realistic view of how the product should look based on the discussion and decision making of the previous two sections. At the end of this exercise, each Product Manager will receive the ideas, creative 8s and solution sketches from each other Product Manager.

### Required Materials

Paper and Pen.

### Workflow

1. Each Product Manager should take a reasonable amount of time \(between 10 and 30 minutes\) to draw up a solution sketch that shows the user's journey through the product. This should involve a few key pages with features that have been discussed previously as well as links between the pages and design elements that stood out throughout.
2. This exercise is the longest so far that participants will work by themselves so it is useful if they facilitators move around the room looking at the sketches and encouraging anyone who seems lacking in inspiration.
3. By the end of this exercise, there should be a range of sketches which reflect aspects discussed and were built throughout the sketching process but each Solution Sketch will be unique and have its own stand-out qualities.
4. After the participants have had enough time to sketch their solutions, the group should be brought back together in discussion.
5. All of the sketches shall be put somewhere where everyone can see them and the participants can spend some time reviewing and discussing the sketches.
6. Aspects which stand out can be dotted in order to provide a record of the highlights of each sketch. These dots do not represent a final decision but are intended as a record of opinion.

### Collaboration

During this exercise, participants will spend time alone drawing upon the ideas of the group. After they've had good time to think deeply about how they'd represent the ideas, they come back together to discuss each other's work. By this point there shall have been a good amount of discussion on each and there should be some convergence in the sketching. From here, Product Managers can take the sketches back to their organisations and will have multiple paper prototypes for their product.
