# The List of Exercises

Here are a list of all exercises found in the design sprint workshops. Each exercise is adaptable and can be reorganised into the Discovery and Definition sections of the programme. Refer to the list here to read specifically about each activity.

### For facilitators

Each of these exercises are adaptable and can be reorganised depending on the needs of the group you are facilitating. Tailoring the workshop by cherry picking specific exercises and arranging them in a certain order is a really powerful way of helping your user group process their problem areas and solutions. Your workshops become bespoke but still follow the design sprint structure.
