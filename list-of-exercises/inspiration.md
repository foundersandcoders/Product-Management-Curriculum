# Inspiration

### Introduction

By looking at similar solutions, design elements or apps that they like, Product Managers will begin thinking about how the solution they'd like to create may look like. It is key here to have already discussed the goal or insights that a Product Manager has formed before embarking on finding inspiration.

### Required Materials

A laptop or computer - ideally one each but this could be done on one device.

### Workflow

1. Thinking about one idea at a time, Product Managers shall research similar solutions or design aspects which could help them in their own design work.
2. Add detail to a shared document \(Figma, Creately, Google Doc\). This can include: images, icons, bullet points, headings, inter alia. Anything that can help to form an idea about how to solve the Product Manager's problem.
3. The group should discuss ideas around what is shared on the document. If one participant brings up a solution, another Product Manager might know of something similar. Often the ideas will not be solving the same problem but could solve a similar problem or even simply represent information in a pleasing way.

### Collaboration

During this exercise it is important to facilitate the collaboration of idea sharing. One Product Manager might have a lot of ideas about how their product should look but there will be apps, websites or design aspects they have never seen before. Sharing ideas amongst the group will encourage a democratic and inclusive approach to problem solving.

It is important to have the document of inspiration somewhere that all participants can see. This means that everyone can contribute and can build upon one another's ideas.
