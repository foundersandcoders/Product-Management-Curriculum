# Assumptions to Questions

## Introduction

This exercise will turn assumptions into questions that can be used in User Research. The exercise is straightforward and helps flesh out a user research script.

This could be combined with the Assumptions Table exercise to create a table with three columns. However, we find that thinking about this in two steps will help focus the measures of validation and ensure the questions directly address the assumption.

## Required Materials

Paper and Pen.

## Workflow

1. This exercise is fairly simple. We start by taking an already formulated list of assumptions.
2. Participants should be provided with an example for how this may be rephrased as a question. 
3. Ask the participants to convert their assumptions into questions by thinking about how to validate the assumptions. 

## Example

**Assumption**

Users are comfortable speaking to their phone.

**Question**

Do you ever use apps which require you to speak to your phone?
