# Speedy 8s

### Introduction

In this exercise, Product Managers will have to come up with eight new and slightly different ideas in rapid succession. By doing so, they are encouraged to diverge in their thinking as well as to think outside the box.

### Required Materials

Paper and pens.

### Workflow

1. Each participant folds their piece of paper in half 3 times to get 8 panels of equal size.
2. The facilitator can decide whether to give 1 or 2 minutes per section.
3. In each panel, participants should draw/visualise their ideas. They are encouraged to try out different ideas and diverge as much as they want: iterating the same aspect in different ways or trying out many elements of an idea.
4. Set a timer, and after this goes off the participant must move on to the next panel with prompts from the facilitator about the current panel number they should be completing.
5. In collaboration, it can be really useful to swap sheets and get inspiration from each other just like in [Idea Generation](idea-generation.md). Whether the organisations have distinct focuses or are collaborating on a shared goal, inspiration can be drawn from each participants rapid production of ideas.
6. The participants should be encouraged to discuss the new sheets they have in front of them.
7. After some discussion, participants can *dot vote* elements they like best. The sheets should be moved somewhere accessible for everyone to see. It is good to limit the number of dots per person at 3-5. Participants may dot an aspect of their own or can use all their dots on other people's sheets.

### Collaboration

As with [Idea Generation](idea-generation.md), this exercise will encourage participants to take new insight on solving the problem. By inverting the direction of swaps the ideas remain fresh and enticing.

This is the first exercise where we introduce more formal [Dot Voting](dot-voting.md). This allows for participants to sum up the discussion in a non-verbal manner as well as to provide a record of which aspects were most popular. During the dot voting, the participants are not voting for their favourite panels but are focusing on aspects they find stand out.
