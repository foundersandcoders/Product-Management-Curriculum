# Product Owner

## What is a Product Owner? 

The Product Owner is a specific one-person role within the Scrum framework, which may be provided by the client or sit within the agency. You are predestined to act as a PO due to your business know-how and corporate authority.

## Responsibilities of a Product Owner

According to the SCRUM documentation, the product owner has three primary responsibilities: 

### **1. Maximising the delivered value**

To this end, the PO must: 

* know the business 
* have a vision of the product 
* be able to define the elements that create value
* be able to prioritise these elements according to this rule: 

> **first \(as far as dependencies allow\) the elements of maximum Value at least Cost.**

### 2. Managing the Product Backlog 

The PO must ensure that a Product Backlog exists and is always up to date. The task of writing the Product Backlog can be delegated but the PO must participate in its definition and description. The PO must guide the people who write the Product Backlog. 

The [Product Backlog](#Product-Backlog) is a list of everything that is known to be needed in the product. It is the single **source of requirements** for any changes to be made to the product. 

The Product Backlog: 

* is **dynamic;** it constantly changes to identify what the product needs to be appropriate, competitive and useful. 
* sits **outside the sprint loop** \(meaning it contains work that will not be completed during the current sprint\) but informs how your sprint will be planned 
* is composed of feedback from **the development team, customer** and **stakeholders**
