# Glossary

### Product Backlog

The Product Backlog is a list of everything that is known to be needed in the product. It is the single **source of requirements** for any changes to be made to the product. The Product Owner is responsible for [managing the Product Backlog](product-owner.md#2-managing-the-product-backlog). 

### Product Owner

The Product Owner is a specific one-person role within the Scrum framework, which may be provided by the client or sit within the agency. As the product lead with your charity, you are predestined to act as a PO due to your business know-how and corporate authority. During the build phase, the product owner has [three primary responsibilities](product-owner.md#responsibilities-of-a-product-owner). 

### Product Roadmap 

A product roadmap is a high-level visual summary that maps out the vision and direction of your product offering over time. A product roadmap communicates the why and what behind what you are building. A roadmap is a guiding strategic document as well as a plan for executing the strategy.

### Scrum Master

A **scrum master** is the facilitator for an Agile development team; they are responsible for managing the process, and only the process. They are not involved in the decision-making, but act as a lodestar to guide the team through the scrum process with their experience and expertise. People filling this role have to lead from a position of influence, often taking a servant-leadership stance.

### Sprint Goal 

The Sprint Goal is an objective to be met by the Sprint through the implementation of part of the Product Backlog. It provides guidance to the Development Team on why it is building the Increment. It is created during the [Sprint Planning ](glossary.md#sprint-planning)meeting. It should be **measurable, focused** and **clear.** 

_**Bad example:** Enhance shopping cart functionality._

_**Good example:** Streamline purchasing process to enable an increase in conversion rates._

### Sprint Planning 

Sprint Planning is a regular event in the Scrum framework where the team determines the Product Backlog items they will work on during that sprint and discusses their initial plan for completing those product backlog items. Sprint Planning is time-boxed to a maximum of eight hours for a one-month Sprint. For shorter Sprints, the event is usually shorter. The PO is responsible for [leading the Sprint Planning](product-owner.md#3-leading-regular-sprint-events). 

### Sprint Retrospective 

The Sprint Retrospective is a meeting for the Scrum Team to inspect itself and create a plan for improvements to be enacted during the next Sprint. It occurs after the Sprint Review and prior to the next Sprint Planning. This is at most a three-hour meeting for one-month Sprints. For shorter Sprints, the event is usually shorter. The PO should attend the [Sprint Retrospective](product-owner.md#3-leading-regular-sprint-events). 

### Sprint Review 

A Sprint Review is an informal meeting held at the end of the Sprint to inspect the Increment and adapt the Product Backlog if needed. It is at most a four-hour meeting for one-month Sprints. For shorter Sprints, the event is usually shorter. The Sprint Review is [led by the PO](product-owner.md#3-leading-regular-sprint-events). 

### Story Points 

Story points are a unit of measure for expressing an estimate of the overall effort that will be required to fully implement a product backlog item or any other piece of work. When we estimate with story points, we assign a point value to each item. The raw values we assign are unimportant. What matters are the _relative values_. A story that is assigned a 2 should be twice as much as a story that is assigned a 1.
