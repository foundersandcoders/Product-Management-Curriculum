# Common Areas

## Introduction

This workshop is intended for groups of Product Managers who are working in a shared problem space - for example, a group of charities who work with people who have experienced domestic abuse.

The idea behind this exercise is to promote a discussion amongst participants on where their user research might converge or whether they have a shared user group. This workshop can help to encourage a shared experience during the Discovery Phase.

## Required Materials

Participants must have already discussed their ideas to some extent openly. We recommend conducting [The Bigger Picture](the-bigger-picture.md) before this exercise.

Post-it Notes and a Whiteboard can be useful here.

## Workflow

1. Compare notes from previous discussion and look for areas which are common between all Product Managers.
2. This may not necessarily be the same problem area but could involve similar research techniques, user groups or inspirations.
3. Product Managers should each suggest an item which they believe is common between all participants. 
4. These should be formulated on a whiteboard or on Post-its where all participants can see. 

Product Managers should be encouraged to use the common areas to formulate user-research questions that could be asked to each of their user groups. This will encourage collaboration in the moment as well as later on if the same Product Managers are given opportunity to compare results.
